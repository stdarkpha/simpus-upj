# Pusher WebSocket Setup Guide - Shared Hosting Compatible

## Backend Setup Complete ✅

The Laravel backend is now configured for **shared hosting** with:

1. **Public Channels** - No authentication needed, perfect for shared hosting
2. **Pusher Credentials** - Updated in `.env` with your actual credentials
3. **NotificationCreated Event** - Broadcasts to public channels `notifications.user.{user_id}`
4. **No Channel Authorization** - Removed private channel authentication
5. **Broadcast Service Provider** - Registered in `bootstrap/providers.php`
6. **Simplified API Routes** - No broadcasting auth routes needed

## How It Works (Shared Hosting Compatible)

When a notification is created in `LendingController::confirm()`:

1. A `Notification` record is saved to the database
2. The `NotificationCreated` event is broadcast via Pusher to **public channel**
3. The event is sent to the channel `notifications.user.{user_id}`
4. Frontend clients listening to this channel receive the notification in real-time
5. **No server authentication needed** - works perfectly on shared hosting!

## Why This Works on Shared Hosting

✅ **Public Channels**: No server-side authentication required
✅ **Direct Pusher Connection**: Frontend connects directly to Pusher, not your server
✅ **No WebSocket Server**: Pusher handles all WebSocket infrastructure
✅ **Simple Configuration**: Just Pusher credentials needed

## Frontend Integration Examples

### JavaScript/Vue.js Frontend (Current Implementation)

```javascript
// No authentication needed for public channels
const pusher = new Pusher("668d263d6e1fb690800d", {
   cluster: "ap1",
   forceTLS: true,
});

// Subscribe to user's public notification channel
const channel = pusher.subscribe(`notifications.user.${userId}`);

// Listen for notification events
channel.bind("notification.created", (data) => {
   console.log("New notification received:", data);
   // Handle the notification in your UI
});
```

````

Example Vue.js component:

```javascript
import Pusher from "pusher-js";

export default {
   mounted() {
      // Initialize Pusher
      const pusher = new Pusher("668d263d6e1fb690800d", {
         cluster: "ap1",
         encrypted: true,
         authEndpoint: "http://your-backend-url/api/broadcasting/auth",
         auth: {
            headers: {
               Authorization: "Bearer " + this.$auth.token, // Your Sanctum token
               Accept: "application/json",
            },
         },
      });

      // Subscribe to user's private channel
      const channel = pusher.subscribe(`private-user.${this.$auth.user.id}`);

      // Listen for notification events
      channel.bind("notification.created", (data) => {
         console.log("New notification received:", data);

         // Show notification to user (toast, popup, etc.)
         this.$toast.success(data.title);

         // Update notifications list in your store/state
         this.$store.dispatch("notifications/addNotification", data);
      });
   },
};
````

### React Native Frontend

Install Pusher JS:

```bash
npm install pusher-js
```

Example React Native usage:

```javascript
import Pusher from "pusher-js/react-native";

useEffect(() => {
   const pusher = new Pusher("668d263d6e1fb690800d", {
      cluster: "ap1",
      encrypted: true,
      authEndpoint: "http://your-backend-url/api/broadcasting/auth",
      auth: {
         headers: {
            Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}`, // Your Sanctum token
            Accept: "application/json",
         },
      },
   });

   const channel = pusher.subscribe(`private-user.${userId}`);

   channel.bind("notification.created", (data) => {
      console.log("New notification:", data);

      // Show local notification
      LocalNotifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
         content: {
            title: data.title,
            body: data.desc,
         },
         trigger: null,
      });

      // Update your notifications state
      setNotifications((prev) => [data, ...prev]);
   });

   return () => {
      pusher.disconnect();
   };
}, []);
```

## Testing the Setup

1. **Test Pusher Connection**:

   -  Use the test endpoint: `POST /api/test/pusher` (with Sanctum auth)
   -  This will create a test notification and broadcast it

2. **Monitor Pusher Dashboard**:

   -  Go to your Pusher app dashboard
   -  Check the "Debug Console" to see real-time events

3. **Test with Postman**:
   ```bash
   POST http://your-backend-url/api/test/pusher
   Headers:
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SANCTUM_TOKEN
   Accept: application/json
   ```

## Important Notes for Shared Hosting

✅ **Works on Shared Hosting**: Pusher is a cloud service, so it works perfectly on shared hosting
✅ **No Server Configuration**: No need to install WebSocket servers or configure ports
✅ **SSL Support**: Pusher handles SSL/TLS encryption automatically
✅ **Reliable**: Pusher handles connection management, reconnection, and scaling

## Troubleshooting

1. **Check .env Variables**: Ensure all Pusher credentials are correct
2. **Clear Config Cache**: Run `php artisan config:clear` if needed
3. **Check Logs**: Monitor `storage/logs/laravel.log` for broadcast errors
4. **Pusher Debug**: Use Pusher's debug console to see if events are being sent

## Next Steps

1. Update your frontend to listen for `notification.created` events
2. Test the real-time notifications when users perform lending actions
3. Consider adding other notification types (overdue books, approvals, etc.)
4. Implement notification read/unread status if needed
